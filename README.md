# No Man's Connect

This is a location manager that syncs your current game's coordinates, uploads them to a server, and indexes a list of everyone's coordinates using the app. It also provides a map that plots your coordinates relative to the center of the galaxy.

This is currently needing more testing, so please back up your save files! 

If you don't see other people's coordinates you will need to run the app as an administrator for now.

This includes a binary of Matthew Humphrey's [nmssavetool](https://github.com/matthew-humphrey/nmssavetool) for decrypting save files.

## Features

 * Syncs coordinates while the game is running after each save
 * Upload coordinates and have them tagged with your Steam ID
 * Add descriptions to locations for other's to view
 * Map all locations on a galaxy map
 * Ability to switch game modes
